#### PITT-Data-Structures-2016

Completing these projects refined my skills to think critically about:
1. abstract data types
2. the implementation of various data structures from scratch
3. an intermediate view of various sorting, searching, and metrics algorithms
4. BigO and situational performance of data structures and algorithms
4. a well-rounded view of data structures and a situational awareness regarding how and when to use them
